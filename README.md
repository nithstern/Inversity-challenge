# Inversity-challenge
my submission to an inversity challenge
if you want to see the code switch to the master branch

To create my project i used an ai called claude.ai
This was very useful to create my project. 
I started by asking it to create a simple help page for gov.uk
I then added more things to the website asking it to be more colourful add more information and more
whilst i was doing this i made a protype design which i would use as an example.

so the protype design was quite simple. it had a basic design of the gov.uk website and hasnt gotten much too it. 
i added an area where you could search and then also an area where you would be able to read some information you need like tips or how to use the website.
i used simple colours like blue and whitew and some black as thats
