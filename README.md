# Inversity-challenge
my submission to an inversity challenge

To create my project i used an ai called claude.ai
This was very useful to create my project. 
I started by asking it to create a simple help page for gov.uk
I then added more things to the website asking it to be more colourful add more information and more
whilst i was doing this i made a protype design which i would use as an example.

so the protype design was quite simple. it had a basic design of the gov.uk website and hasnt gotten much too it. 
i added an area where you could search and then also an area where you would be able to read some information you need like tips or how to use the website.
i used simple colours like blue and whitew and some black as thats what the gov.uk colour scheme is like.
after doinjg some final touches i thought it was a good protype design and decided to get into the coding side of things making sure to use the design as a reference.

The first prototype was made using a claude. how i would do it was number them p for protype and then give them a number to show there version. everytime i changed something about the protype i would change there version so that i could still access the old code. there were a number of problems i came into for example the search bar didnt work and then things like the learn more wouldnt work. it was also not very good to lookj at which meant this needed a lot of work to be done if i wanted it to be what i wanted.

the first problem i fixed was the search bar not working. alot of people who tested it complained about this and so did i so i thought it would be the best thing to start off with. i made it answer some question by using the help of ai like chat gpt and claude and eventually got it to work. the next problem i needed to fix was the learn more parts. I started creating an area for tips and made it that at first they would give you a simple tip then if you wanted to learn more you youd click on the learn more part and it would expand it teaching you a bit more. thewn it would also have a link to a part of gov.uk which would refer to the tip. then i had some trouble with the links and the learn more expanding info and so had to fix that. eventually after some messing around with the code i eventually got it to work write. the next thing i went to was the colour and style of the website. currently it was looking quite plain and so i messed around with the colours making it fit the actual gov.uk website.

after fixing trouble i had some friends tell me some feedback on the website and i tried to incorperate it in the work. some things like they wish thewre were more tips and useful info also requesting that it links back to the actual gov.uk website. And so i did just that. at the bottom i added tips such as what to do if they needed more help and also just basic safety tips. after that i turned my attention to a button that takes you back to the actaul website and so started getting that done. i made it a simple black box with text that says return to gov.uk home. that way it would be obvious what it does. once done i finished up any thing i needed to do.

after hours of working on it i finally manage to finish my project and get it fully coded. i added some touches and then tested everything to make sure it all works and once done started moving my project code onto github. 

if i had more time i would add some improvements. for example using ai to answer any questions you have on the website. this would make it more useful and maybe even more personalised to you. pther things could be more tips and that the search bar workjs for more questionbs you have. aswell as the websiote itself being abit more colourful. of course this website has to be made to fit anyone who uses it. including people who dont use technology alot or people who are of older ages. once done i moved onto my pitch for inversity.
